# GRIT@4MOST

# Abstract:
More than half of the galaxies in the nearby Universe reside in groups, where slow encounters can
already alter their properties before they are accreted into larger systems such as galaxy clusters.
We target transition galaxies-red, low-Sérsic (n<2.5) systems, because they sit between late- and
early-type classes and already show changes: in groups they are smaller at fixed stellar mass and
form fewer stars than in the field, suggesting structural evolution via bulge growth and fading outer
discs. They comprise ~8-10% of group members and are widely dispersed on the sky, demanding
an efficient survey. 4MOST is ideal for this task due to its broad overlap with S-PLUS and
eROSITA surveys. The Low-Resolution Spectrograph (LRS) fibres, covering 370-950 nm at
R≈4000-7800, allow us to derive ages, metallicities, basic kinematics, and to separate star
formation from AGN and shocks. Through the supplementary-target mode, unused fibres are
allocated without additional pointings or observing time, enabling the construction of a clean, sky-
wide sample.

## Notes & Assumptions

PMRA, PMDEC, PARALLAX are set to 0.0 (no Gaia values provided).

RESOLUTION = 1 corresponds to LRS.

EXTENT_PARAMETER is computed from effective radius (re) multiplied by the pixel scale 0.55 arcsec/pix.

RULESET was assigned uniformly as ST_RULESET_LRS; finer ruleset splitting by magnitude is possible but optional.

All calibration columns (CAL_MAG_*) are placeholders filled with 0.0.

## Sample Definition

The 738 galaxies included in this catalogue are red and low-Sérsic systems selected from S-PLUS photometry and structural measurements:

Colour cut: 

(u−r)>2.3, ensuring that the sample contains red galaxies.

Structural cut: Sérsic index in the r-band 

n_r<2.5, selecting galaxies with disc-like or transitional morphologies.

Photometric system: The S-PLUS r filter is designed to be SDSS r-like, ensuring compatibility with Sloan Digital Sky Survey measurements.

This combination of photometric and structural criteria identifies galaxies that are already evolving away from LTG population, making them suitable transition/quenched candidates for spectroscopic follow-up with 4MOST LRS.
